 * This is a node:test reporter that tries to mimic Mocha's default reporter, as

 * It is designed to output information about the test runs as soon as possible
 * and in test definition order.
 *
 * Once the test run ends, it will output global information about it, based on
 * the diagnostics emitted by node:test, and any custom or unrecognized
 * diagnostics message.
 *
 * Finally, it will output the failure reasons for all the failed tests.
